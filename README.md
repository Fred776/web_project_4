# web_project_4: My fourth project with TripleTen.

This is my first project using Javascript. In its earlier iterations it would render a webpage in which the user could create a profile, edit it and add to a preexisting set of location cards set on places of interest inside the United States and abroad. As there was no backend database connected to it, the saved profile and location cards would only be available as long as the page was left open.  

After multiple iterations and improvements, the project is now connected to a backend api created by TripleTen which saves user information and cards from the entire student cohort and renders them on the page at load time. 

The site's main javascript components are the frontend api used to fetch data, interactive popups which display forms and location images, and the location cards. All Popup forms use form validation.

Webpack as been used to compile the site.

Thanks again to TripleTen for providing me with the materials and instructions to build this project!
