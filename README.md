# web_project_4
## My fourth project at Practicum.

This is my first dynamic website using Javascript. It started as a vanilla javascript project rendering a webpage in which the user can edit a profile and add to a preexisting set of cards focused on places of interest in the United States.  

After multiple iterations and improvements, the project is now connected to a backend api created by Practicum which saves user information and cards from the entire student cohort and renders them on the page at load time.
