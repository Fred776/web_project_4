## My fourth project at Practicum by Yandex.

My fourth project at Practicum. This is my first interactive website using Javascript. The user can enter his name and profession into a modal form and the submitted information appears as part of the HTML code in the website.

Here is a link to the Github repository: (https://fred776.github.io/web_project_4/ "My project")
